ABSTRACT
We derive the heavy element abundances for hundreds of K-giants in
seven windows of low extinction, along or near the minor axis of the Galactic
bulge. By using the recently-calibrated Washington photometric filter
system, the distribution function in [Fe/H] is determined for each field.
Within 8° of the Galactic center 1 kpc) our data are consistent with no
gradient in the distribution of [Fe/H], which may hint to a dissipationless
collapse, and/or sufficient mixing during the star-forming epoch when Fe was
produced in the bulge. The mean abundance over this region is between two
and five times solar. The form of these distributions is well-fitted by the
simple (closed box) model of chemical evolution where the bulge is selfenriched by processing its original gas content to completion. Beyond 8°
from the Galactic center, our data show that the mean of the abundance
distributions drops precipitously. This is consistent with the notion that the
inner bulge is chemically distinct from the halo.
1. OBSERVATIONS
We used the recently calibrated Washington photometric system
(Geisler, et al. 1991) to obtain photometric abundances for hundreds of Réglants in seven low extinction windows to the Galactic bulge. The data were
obtained on the 0.9m telescope at CTIO. Abundances accurate to ±0.25 dex
in [Fe/H] were derived for each K-giant using the metallicity-sensitive indices
of the Washington system. (For a recent review of the Washington system
see Tyson 1991).
2. ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTIONS
The shape of the stellar abundance distribution holds valuable
information about the history of chemical enrichment in a system. The
distributions for the inner fields (i.e. b = -2.7°, -4°, -6°) bear a remarkable
resemblance to the gaussian-convolved abundance distribution of the closed
box, simple model of chemical evolution (Searle & Zinn 1978, also Rich
1990). Fig. 1 displays the abundance distribution for the inner-most field of
this study. Error bars represent the typical errors in precision for a single
observation derived from the photometric uncertainties. There is the

characteristic extended tail toward lower abundances and the relatively steep
shoulder at high abundance. Consequently, our data suggest that the bulge
abundance distributions, out to b = -6°, are consistent with a fully mixed,
closed box, simple model of chemical evolution that has processed its gas to
completion.
3. DISCUSSION
To supplement interpretation of the abundance distributions we can
look at the run of the log mean abundance, [<Fe/H>], as a function of
Galactic latitude. This constitutes the first direct measurement of the latitude
dependence of [Fe/H] in the Galactic bulge. Fig. 2 presents these data. The
errors are large, but two convincing features are immediately apparent: [1]
The inner latitudes stay at roughly constant mean abundance [Fe/H] « 0.4 ±
0.3 (r < 1 kpc), which suggests that the bulge, within about 1 kpc, is a
chemically well-mixed volume. There is a small trend for [<Fe/H>] to drop
within b = -6°, but given the relatively large errors, it is not clear whether
much should be made of this feature. The fact that the abundance
distributions for the three inner latitudes show good agreement with the
analytic form of the abundance distribution from the closed box simple model
suggests strongly that the inner bulge is self-enriched. [2] Outside of the
inner 1 kpc, the mean abundance begin a precipitous 1.5 dex drop to latitude
b = - 17.3°. This drop is remarkable when we consider that it occurs over
just 1 kpc. The la error bars in Fig. 2 are computed from the photometric
and zero-point errors. The statistical uncertainty in the mean abundance (σ /
N~m) for each field is considerably smaller.
4. FUTURE
One of the most useful aspects of the Washington system is its ability
to flag interesting stars of unusually high (or low) abundance for follow-up
spectroscopy. As emphasized by D. Terndrup at this conference, the idea of
a kinematic dependence on abundance in the Galactic bulge is an exciting
topic that demands much further study. In collaboration with D. N. Spergel
(Princeton), we plan to obtain medium resolution spectra of the highest and
lowest abundance stars from the abundance distributions of this study.
Spergel has developed computer models of the Galactic bulge that allow one
to derive observable quantities from segregated orbit families in phase space.
We expect this approach to be a powerful analytic tool that will enable
interpretive leverage on abundance and velocity distributions that would not
otherwise be possible.
